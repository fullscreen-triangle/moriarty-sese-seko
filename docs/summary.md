# Moriarty Project Documentation Summary

This document provides a summary of all markdown documentation files in the Moriarty project.

## Core Documentation

1. **README.md** - The primary project overview document. It's excessively long (722 lines) and appears to describe a comprehensive framework for analyzing sports videos using computer vision, distributed computing, and AI. However, it contains many aspirational features and may not accurately reflect the actual implemented functionality.

2. **INSTALL.md** - Installation guide providing multiple ways to install the Moriarty package, including from source, using setup scripts, or manual dependency installation. Includes environment setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.

3. **pipeline.md** - Detailed documentation of the key pipelines within the Moriarty system, including function calls, inputs/outputs, and execution flow. Covers both the Sprint Running Video Analysis Pipeline and Domain Expert LLM Training Pipeline with example code.

## Documentation in the `/docs` Directory

1. **tasks.md** - A comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the project organized into categories: Architecture, Performance, Code Quality, Testing, Documentation, Feature, Security/Privacy, Deployment/DevOps, Data Management, and User Experience. Tasks are marked with checkboxes for tracking completion status.

2. **README_orchestration.md** - Details the Motion Analysis Orchestration System that integrates VisualKinetics and Graffiti packages into a unified, distributed processing pipeline for sports video analysis. Covers architecture, installation, component implementation, workflow configurations, monitoring, error handling, and scaling.

3. **README_Graffiti.md** - Documentation for the Graffiti framework for human motion analysis, biomechanical assessment, and sport-specific performance evaluation. Includes mathematical foundations, implementation details, validation methods, and performance analysis. Contains extensive mathematical formulas and technical specifications.

4. **README_PIPELINE.md** - A concise overview of the distributed video processing pipeline that processes videos to extract pose data, generate annotated videos, and train LLMs. Describes features, prerequisites, usage examples, command-line options, architecture, and troubleshooting steps.

5. **README_RAG.md** - Documentation for the VisualKinetics RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System, which allows users to create an LLM-powered query interface for processed sports videos. Covers features, setup, usage, system architecture, and API integration.

6. **README_LLM.md** - Describes the VisualKinetics LLM Training System for extracting pose data from sports videos, converting it to text descriptions for LLM training, and training small language models. Includes features, prerequisites, usage examples, and advanced configuration options.

## Summary of Project Structure

Based on the documentation, Moriarty appears to be a complex system with several integrated components:

1. **Core Video Analysis** - Processing sports videos to extract biomechanical data
2. **Distributed Computing** - Using Ray and Dask for parallel processing
3. **Biomechanical Analysis** - Analyzing pose data for sports performance insights
4. **LLM Integration** - Training language models on biomechanical data
5. **RAG System** - Creating queryable interfaces for video analysis data
6. **Orchestration** - Coordinating different components through message queues

The documentation suggests a comprehensive system with advanced capabilities, though there appears to be some disconnect between described features and what may actually be implemented, as indicated by the task list with many uncompleted items.
